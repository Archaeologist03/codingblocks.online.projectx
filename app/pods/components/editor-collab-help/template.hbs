  <h2>What is Collborate Mode?</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    When you ask a doubt related to programming problem, you can use 
    <b>Collaborate Mode</b> to share your code editor with a TA. 
    With the collaborate mode on, you and your TA can collaborate in realtime to 
    debug your code and help you solve the challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can switch back to <b>Normal Mode</b> anytime and your editor
    will no longer connected to your TA.
  </p>

  <mark>
    TL;DR: Keep <b>Collaborate Mode</b> when you want to share your code with
    TA in realtime. Use <b>Normal Mode</b> when you are working on your own.
